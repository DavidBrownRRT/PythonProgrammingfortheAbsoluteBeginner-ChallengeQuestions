#Hereâ€™s a bigger challenge. Write the pseudocode for a
#program where the player and the computer trade places
#in the number guessing game. That is, the player picks
#a random number between 1 and 100 that the computer has
#to guess. Before you start, think about how you guess.
#If all goes well, try coding the game.
#------------
#Pseudo code
#Introduce game to user
#Player picks a random number between 1 and 100
#User inputs number, "secret number"
#Computer tries to guess with initial guess
#Number is evaluated against secret number
#If first guess > secret number a meassage is displayed stating to guess lower
#If first guess < secret number a message is displayed stating to guess higher
#Computer continues guess number
#Evaluate subsequent computer guesses against secret number
#Tighten computer guess range per evaluation
#Guess until computer guess equals secret number or guess tries >20
#Notify user if computer guess correctly and display number of tries
#Notify computer that number of tries exceeded and game is over
