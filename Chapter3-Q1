#Challenge question 1:
#Write a program that simulates a fortune cookie.
#The program should display one of five unique fortunes, at random, each time itâ€™s run.

# Fortune Cookie
# Displays Random Fortune
# Allows user to see repeated random fortunes up to 5
#David A Brown

#Import the random module
import random

#Print header
print("\t\t~~Cyber Fortune Cookie~~")

#Initial instructions for user
input("  \n\tHit ENTER to see your fortune")

# Set the initial values
prefix = "Your fortune is: "
count = 0
fortune1 = "When much wine goes in very bad things come out."
fortune2 = "You will be hungry in one hour."
fortune3 = "Order another egg roll and you will be happy."
fortune4 = "You will love the spicy ginger shrimp."
fortune5 = "You will meet an old friend soon."

#Loop for selecting random fortunes
while True:
    #Picks a random number
    number = random.randint (1,6)
    #if and elif statements for fortune output
    if number == 1:

    elif number == 5:
        print("\n", prefix, fortune5)
        count += 1
    #Gives user choice of getting another fortune or exiting program
    if input("\nHit Enter for another fortune or 'y' + Enter to exit. ").lower() == 'y':

    #Sentinel to close program after 5 fortunes are displayed
